# spotify_streaming_history

These are just a few queries I did to find some basic info on my spotify streaming history. I queried the top 5 most frequently played songs along with the most played track, and the most streamed artists.

MORE TO COME!!

I also created a dashboard on Looker Studio illustrating my top streams on Spotify, the number of streams each of those artist got, and how many minutes they were streamed in total.
